                        <p>My name is Michael Partin, I am a Print Nerd&trade;, Designer, and Full Stack Web Developer. I have two kids, a dog, and a Jeep. When I am not behind a computer, I am out where only Sat phones work! Find out more about me below:</p>
                        <p>I have been management within the print industry for the last decade, in the industry for nearly 20 years. I work well with teams and get great reviews from people with whom I have worked. I have had extensive time working with programs like Photoshop and Illustrator. I have a side business where I design for print. Wine labels are the majority of my work.</p>
                        <p>I have been doing web development on and off for the past few years. This year I decided to make a commitment to changing careers into the tech sector. Currently I am enrolled in a full stack developer course at UC Berkeley. Please look through my projects and contact me with any questions you may have. Thank you for your time!</p>
